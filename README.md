1. Download datasets to `data/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd data/
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    wget http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
    ```
2. Unpack datasets in `data/` directory:
    ```bash
